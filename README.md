# Coding Bootcamp

Exercises, resources, and examples to learn how to code in different languages.

## Setup

Welcome! You have already made the most diffucult step in finding this repo. Now follow the upcoming steps to get your computer setup and then choose the language folder you would like to learn. Soon you will be an expert coder!

### Text Editor

First thing you will want to do is to download a text editior. This will be where you will be writing you code. The text editor will be your companion on your jounery and there are a lot of features built it to help find mistakes, help you run your code, and even give you suggestions on how to write you code. My favorite text editor is visual studio. Go to this [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to download.

### Github

Next you will want to create your own [github](https://github.com/join?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home) account, where you can upload and save your code. This is how you are reading this now.

### Git

In addition you will want to download [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Git is a great tool and used by all developers to save, update, and share code with themselves and in teams.
This is a useful [tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-basics-of-git-in-under-10-minutes-da548267cc91/) if you want to learn the basics, but I will let you know the commands you will need for this bootcamp.

To download this repo and all of its code you will run the command:

`git clone https://github.com/anovis/bootcamp.git`

This downloads the code to your computer. If there are updates, you can just run the command

`git pull` to get the latest code.

To create a new repo for youself to save your code as you go along go to github and click the button `add repository` and follow the steps there.

Useful commands you will need to know are `git commit -a -m "THIS IS A MESSAGE ABOUT THE CHANGES YOU MADE"` which saves you code. Replace the all caps section with a message about the code changes you made.

After running the commit command run `git push`, which will upload your changes to github.

Thats it, you are ready to go. Check out the language you want to learn by clicking into the desired folder. If you have any questions feel free to post [here](`https://github.com/anovis/bootcamp/issues`)

### Resources

If you habe a questio, one of the best resources out there is [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), which is the most popular Q&A site. Chances are someone else has run into the same error or problem and posted the question there, with many others providing answers. Most professional coders still spend a lot of time on stackoverflow, but the difference is with time you will become better at finding the right question to ask.
